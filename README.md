# LLm Prompts

Just a collection of prompts for LLMs.  Handy to use or to put as commands in claude code, cursor, etc.

For claude code for instance, do :


```sh 
mkdir ~/.claude/commands
cp prompts/*.md ~/.claude/commands/
```

Then in claude code you can just do `/name-of-prompt-filename` to run it.
